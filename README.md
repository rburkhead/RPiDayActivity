# RPiDayActivity

## Summary
A one or two hour hands on activity using a PIR motion sensor, Raspberry Pi, and Python code. Students create a simple motion sensor alarm that protects their pie (or other valuables). I designed the activity with beginners and kids in mind. The activity requires no soldering and no prior coding experience. 

## Motivation

The San Diego Library Maker Lab asked me to "teach something with Raspberry Pis" for Pi Day. I wanted to do a hands on activity with both hardware and software. I was also promised pie.

## Equipment List

1. Raspberry Pi with Raspbian installed
1. HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor. [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_85_0?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3AHC-SR501%2Cp_85%3A2470955011&keywords=HC-SR501&ie=UTF8&qid=1458703999&rnid=2470954011)
